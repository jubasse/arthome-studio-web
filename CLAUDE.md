## Load the Angular router before writing code — every session, without exception

**`angular-how-to`.** Load it at the start of any task that writes, reviews or debugs code here, and
load the skills it routes to. This includes the first task after a context compaction: a compacted
session keeps the conclusions and loses the reflex.

**Follow those skills to the letter.** They are the project's chosen best practices, not
suggestions, and they are more current than any model's memory of Angular.

⚠ **The lesson this instruction comes from was paid for in another repository.** arthome-platform's
services were written without loading `nestjs-how-to`. The router's own rule is
`MUST load skills before writing code`, and when one of the routed skills was finally opened it
corrected two defects that were already committed. Skills trigger on their descriptions, and an
agent that believes it already knows the framework skips them.

## The domain is not defined here

Entities, vocabularies, error codes and boundary DTOs come from `@arthome/core` and
`@arthome/contracts`. The architecture, the ADRs and the arbitration log live in
**[arthome-core](https://github.com/jubasse/arthome-core)** — see `README.md`.

## Comments — delete by default

**The default is no comment.** Name it first: `waitUntilDue` needs no gloss, `handleRetryTiming`
needs one. Then comment only what a name cannot carry.

**The test**: would a reader with this code in front of them learn something they could not derive
from it?

**Keep** — a measured failure with what it cost · a constraint invisible at that line · a decision
and its reason · a `⚠` where the obvious change is wrong.

**Delete** — a comment on trivial code (a delegate, a getter, a `findAll` calling `Model.findAll`) ·
a block above a name that already carries it · JSDoc restating the signature · narration of a
readable sequence · history · a default explained · prose about what the file does *not* do.

**Where one line does, use one line.** A surviving `⚠` is two to four lines, never ten.

⚠ **Never delete a recorded measurement** — shorten its prose to one sentence, keep the fact. And
**never a one-line gloss on an exported name**: `REPOSITORY_MAP.md` is generated from it.

⚠ **The mechanism that produces the problem**: paying yourself in comment lines for what the
discovery cost. That belongs in the commit message, not at the line.

Full rule, with four measured shapes: `code-conventions.md` §5.10.
